The naming of images in this folder is highly regular and the pattern must be maintained for new additions to the program to easily be made. 

- All images are in .PNG format for the sake of simplicity. If future distributions change this, it is recommended that they change the formatting of all images to the new format.

STANDARD FILES:
	- The first number in each name refers to which category in physics the image belongs to. All digits that come after it are to be read as a single number referring to which equation inside of that category the image represents. 

OMNI FILES:
	- Files with the prefix "omni" contain a single image representing all of the equations in the category of physics represented by the number that follows the prefix.

DOCX FILES:
	- .docx files contain the MS Office equations used in the images in an editable format. The digit that is the name of the file represents which category in physics the file corresponds to.
